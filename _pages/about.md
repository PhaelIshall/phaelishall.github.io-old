Hi there. My name is Wiem (wiː æm / ウイエム). I recently completed my Master's of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence at Tokyo Institute of Technology (東京工業大学）where I am member of Okazaki lab（岡崎研究室), a Natural Language Processing lab. Before that, I was also a member of Tsuruoka lab in the University of Tokyo（東京大学), as a research student. 

I am currently conducting research in Explainable AI in the context of NLP and Knowledge Graphs Embeddings. I'm also always up to date with research related to Commonsense reasoning, which has a special place in my heart. I have a background of work and internships at startups as an mobile developer, so I am naturally interested in applied Machine Learning as well (and a fan of clean, well-thought-out code). 

I obtained my bachelor's of Science in Computer Science from the American University of Beirut, in Lebanon where I minored in applied mathematics and philosophy. I am originally from a beautiful coastal city in Tunisia, North Africa. 

I was lucky to be the recipient of various scholarships and grants that covered my higher education journey, and therefore I am always happy to share my experience and help qualified and motivated people find better opportunities, if I can.
